# Muon Tracking

A model of the CMS detector at CERN implemented using Python. Uses NumPy and matplotlib libraries.

This project aims to investigate the resolution of muon momenta of the trackers in the CMS detector.

Through this investigation, it is possible to also analyse the resolution of the Higgs Boson's and product Z-bosons' masses by considering the resolution of the momentum of their muon decay products.
